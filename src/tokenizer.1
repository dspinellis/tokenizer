.SH NAME
\fBtokenizer\fR \(en convert source code into integer vectors
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtokenizer\fR [\fB\-l \fIlang\fR] [\fB\-o \fIopt\fR] [\fB\-t \fItype\fR] [\fIfile ...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtokenizer\fR utility converts source code specified as files in
its command line or provided through its standard input into integer
vectors.
.IP \(bu
Language keywords and multi-character tokens (e.g. \fC+=\fP) are represented
through unique integers.
.IP \(bu
Numbers are mapped into integers on a logarithmic scale.
.IP \(bu
Other constants (e.g. characters and strings) are represented as an integer
representing the corresponding type.
.IP \(bu
Identifiers are mapped into integers through some lightweight semantic
processing.
.IP \(bu
Comments are mapped into a single integer.
.IP \(bu
Whitespace is not shown in the output.
.IP \(bu
All other characters are represented by the corresponding ASCII code.

.SH OPTIONS
The behavior of the \fBtokenizer\fR utility can be controlled
through the following command-line options.
.RS 3

.TP
.BI "-l " lang
Specify the input language.
Currently the following languages are supported:
\fIJava\fP, \fIC\fP, \fICSharp\fP (or \fIC#\fP), \fIC++\fP, \fIPython\fP.

.TP
.BI "-o " opt
Specify a language-specific processing option.
Multiple \fB-o\fP arguments may be provided.
The following processing options are supported.

.RS 3

.TP
.B file
Output a single vector for the whole file.

.TP
.B method
Output a vector for the contents of each method.

.TP
.B statement
Output a vector for each statement.
.LP
.RE

.TP
.BI "-t " type
Specify the output type.
The following output types are supported.

.RS 3
.TP
.B n
output numeric token values,
.TP
.B s
output symbolic token values,
.TP
.B c
output code tokens, one per line.
.LP

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
An error is displayed when an end of file is encountered while processing
a block comment or a character or string literal.
